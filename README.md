# GalileoX Java Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains the coursework and final project for the GalileoX Java Programming Fundamentals course. The project is structured to demonstrate fundamental Java programming concepts through weekly assignments and a comprehensive final project.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into weekly modules and a final project:

- `week1/` - Introduction to Java basics
- `week2/` - Object-oriented programming fundamentals
- `week3/` - Advanced Java concepts
- `week4/` - Data structures and algorithms
- `week5/` - Advanced topics and project preparation
- `finalproject/` - Comprehensive final project

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.8.1 or higher
- An IDE that supports Java development (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code recommended)

## Dependencies
