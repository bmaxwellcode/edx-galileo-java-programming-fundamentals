/**
 * JVMTuning demonstrates how to optimize Java Virtual Machine settings to
 * address memory issues.
 * 
 * If memory leaks are identified even when objects are unreferenced, there are
 * several
 * JVM tuning options that can help mitigate these issues:
 * 
 * 1. Heap Memory Configuration:
 * - Initial heap size: -Xms[size] (e.g., -Xms256m for 256 megabytes)
 * - Maximum heap size: -Xmx[size] (e.g., -Xmx2g for 2 gigabytes)
 * 
 * 2. Stack Memory Configuration:
 * - Thread stack size: -Xss[size] (e.g., -Xss1m for 1 megabyte per thread)
 * 
 * 3. Garbage Collector Selection:
 * - Choose a specific garbage collector using -XX options, such as:
 * - -XX:+UseSerialGC (Simple, single-threaded collector)
 * - -XX:+UseParallelGC (Parallel collector for throughput)
 * - -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC (CMS collector for low pause times)
 * - -XX:+UseG1GC (G1 collector, balanced throughput and latency)
 * 
 * 4. GC Logging for Analysis:
 * - Enable GC logging: -Xloggc:file_path -XX:+PrintGCDetails
 * 
 * These settings can be applied as command-line arguments when starting a Java
 * application.
